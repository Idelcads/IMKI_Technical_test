## To use the code provided in the folder a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Super-Resolution-master:

* Pre-trained models are not provided. You can download it via this link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12OG-KawSFFs6Pah89V4a_Td-VcwMBE5i \
The files `checkpoint_srresnet.pth` and `checkpoint_srgan.pth` are to put in the folder containing the file `super_resolve.py`

* The file `super_resolve.py` allows to compare the efficiency of three methods : SRGan, SRResNet and bicubic interpolation. 
* The files `train_srgan.py` and `train_srresnet.py` alow to train a new network using a different dataset

## Remarks:

the programs provided are not modified compared to those available in the gitHub : https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Super-Resolution#some-more-examples
